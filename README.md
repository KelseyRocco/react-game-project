# **How To Play Load, Block, Shoot**

You have three options to choose from:
<br>
**Load** - loads your gun  
**Block** - sheilds shots fired at you  
**Shoot** - shoots at your opponent  
<br>

You must **LOAD** bullets in your gun before you can shoot.

You can **BLOCK** incoming shots by using the sheild.

**SHOOT** your opponent before they shoot you!
